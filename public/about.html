<h1>About Me</h1>

  In addition to my academic background, I have had the privilege of undertaking
  internships at renowned organizations such as Goldman Sachs and AWS Cloud
  Management. I have also achieved certifications such as the Pearson mepro
  level 10 Expert and completed the 'Mastering Data Structures using C and C++'
  course on Udemy. My expertise extends to proficiently coding in languages like
  C, C++, Java, and Python, all while maintaining strong problem-solving skills.

<p>
  One of my key attributes lies in effective time management, which I believe
  contributes greatly to my ability to excel both individually and as a
  cooperative team member. However, like everyone, I have areas where I continue
  to grow. I tend to be overly critical of my work at times, always striving for
  perfection. While this drive for excellence can sometimes slow down my
  progress, I also believe it reflects my dedication to producing high-quality
  outcomes. I'm continuously working on finding the right balance between
  striving for excellence and managing my time effectively.
